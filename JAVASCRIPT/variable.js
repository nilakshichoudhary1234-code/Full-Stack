//variables 

let name ="nilakshi";//in let we can change the value 
let age=19;
name="nikhil";

console.log(name , age);

const account = 5247;// in case of the const we cannot change the value 
//account = 23;

console.log(account);

//old method:
var a=10; // the disadvantage of var is that it can assign multiple values to the same variable at the same time.
var a=20;
console.log(a);
